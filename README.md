mageia-custom-rpms
==================

Backported and custom Mageia RPMs

The work here, custom or otherwise is mostly (or exactly) derived from the Mageia SVN (http://svnweb.mageia.org/).

That said - the work is basically in 2 categories/folders.

* cauldron - rpms backported directly from a newer version of Mageia or Cauldron without changes
* custom - rpms that have been altered or writen fresh, including newer versions of existing packages
